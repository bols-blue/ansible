Adds missing sections if they don't exist. Comments are discarded when the source file is read, and therefore will not show up in the destination file."

msgid "A section named ``default`` cannot be added by the module, but if it exists, individual options within the section can be updated. (This is a limitation of Python's *ConfigParser*.) Either use ``template`` to create a base INI file with a ``[default]`` section, or use ``lineinfile`` to add the missing line."
