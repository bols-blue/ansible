msgid "The stock inventory script system detailed above works for all versions of Ansible, but calling ``--host`` for every host can be rather expensive,  especially if it involves expensive API calls to a remote subsystem.  In Ansible 1.3 or later, if the inventory script returns a top level element called \"_meta\", it is possible to return all of the host variables in one inventory script call.  When this meta element contains a value for \"hostvars\", the inventory script will not be invoked with ``--host`` for each host.  This results in a significant performance increase for large numbers of hosts, and also makes client side caching easier to implement for the inventory script."
