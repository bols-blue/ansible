(This is not usually needed for module development, but can be nice for large changes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/community.rst:146

There are more in depth tests in the tests/integration directory, classified as destructive and non_destructive, run these if they pertain to your modification. They are setup with tags so you can run subsets, some of the tests requrie cloud credentials and will only run if they are provided. When adding new features of fixing bugs it would be nice to add new tests to avoid regressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/community.rst:156

msgid "In order to keep the history clean and better audit incoming code, we will require resubmission of pull requests that contain merge commits.  Use \"git pull --rebase\" vs \"git pull\" and \"git rebase\" vs \"git merge\". Also be sure to use topic branches to keep your additions on different branches, such that they won't pick up stray commits later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/community.rst:163
msgid "If you make a mistake you do not need to close your PR, create a clean branch locally and then push to github with --force to overwrite the existing branch (permissible in this case as no one else should be using that branch as reference). Code comments won't be lost, they just won't be attached to the existing branch."

msgid "As we have a very large and active community, so it may take awhile to get your contributions in!  See the notes about priorities in a later section for understanding our work queue. Be patient, your request might not get merged right away, we also try to keep the devel branch more or less usable so we like to examine Pull requests carefully, which takes time."
