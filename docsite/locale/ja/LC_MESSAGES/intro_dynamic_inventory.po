msgid "Often a user of a configuration management system will want to keep inventory in a different software system.  Ansible provides a basic text-based system as described in :doc:`intro_inventory` but what if you want to use something else?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:12
msgid "Frequent examples include pulling inventory from a cloud provider, LDAP, `Cobbler <http://cobbler.github.com>`_, or a piece of expensive enterprisey CMDB software."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:15
msgid "Ansible easily supports all of these options via an external inventory system.  The plugins directory contains some of these already -- including options for EC2/Eucalyptus, Rackspace Cloud, and OpenStack, examples of some of which will be detailed below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:17
msgid ":doc:`tower` also provides a database to store inventory results that is both web and REST Accessible.  Tower syncs with all Ansible dynamic inventory sources you might be using, and also includes a graphical inventory editor. By having a database record of all of your hosts, it's easy to correlate past event history and see which ones have had failures on their last playbook runs."

msgid "Example: The Cobbler External Inventory Script"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:27
msgid "It is expected that many Ansible users with a reasonable amount of physical hardware may also be `Cobbler <http://cobbler.github.com>`_ users.  (note: Cobbler was originally written by Michael DeHaan and is now led by James Cammarata, who also works for Ansible, Inc)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:29
msgid "While primarily used to kickoff OS installations and manage DHCP and DNS, Cobbler has a generic layer that allows it to represent data for multiple configuration management systems (even at the same time), and has been referred to as a 'lightweight CMDB' by some admins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:33
msgid "To tie Ansible's inventory to Cobbler (optional), copy `this script <https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/plugins/inventory/cobbler.py>`_ to /etc/ansible and `chmod +x` the file.  cobblerd will now need to be running when you are using Ansible and you'll need to use Ansible's  ``-i`` command line option (e.g. ``-i /etc/ansible/cobbler.py``). This particular script will communicate with Cobbler using Cobbler's XMLRPC API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:37
msgid "First test the script by running ``/etc/ansible/cobbler.py`` directly.   You should see some JSON data output, but it may not have anything in it just yet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:39
msgid "Let's explore what this does.  In cobbler, assume a scenario somewhat like the following::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:46
msgid "In the example above, the system 'foo.example.com' will be addressable by ansible directly, but will also be addressable when using the group names 'webserver' or 'atlanta'.  Since Ansible uses SSH, we'll try to contact system foo over 'foo.example.com', only, never just 'foo'.  Similarly, if you try \"ansible foo\" it wouldn't find the system... but \"ansible 'foo*'\" would, because the system DNS name starts with 'foo'."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:48
msgid "The script doesn't just provide host and group info.  In addition, as a bonus, when the 'setup' module is run (which happens automatically when using playbooks), the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c' will all be auto-populated in the templates::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:53
msgid "Which could be executed just like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:59
msgid "The name 'webserver' came from cobbler, as did the variables for the config file.  You can still pass in your own variables like normal in Ansible, but variables from the external inventory script will override any that have the same name."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:64
msgid "So, with the template above (motd.j2), this would result in the following data being written to /etc/motd for system 'foo'::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:68
msgid "And on system 'bar' (bar.example.com)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:72
msgid "And technically, though there is no major good reason to do it, this also works too::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:76
msgid "So in other words, you can use those variables in arguments/actions as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:81
msgid "Example: AWS EC2 External Inventory Script"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:83
msgid "If you use Amazon Web Services EC2, maintaining an inventory file might not be the best approach, because hosts may come and go over time, be managed by external applications, or you might even be using AWS autoscaling. For this reason, you can use the `EC2 external inventory  <https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/plugins/inventory/ec2.py>`_ script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:85
msgid "You can use this script in one of two ways. The easiest is to use Ansible's ``-i`` command line option and specify the path to the script after marking it executable::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:90
msgid "The second option is to copy the script to `/etc/ansible/hosts` and `chmod +x` it. You will also need to copy the `ec2.ini  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/plugins/inventory/ec2.ini>`_ file to `/etc/ansible/ec2.ini`. Then you can run ansible as you would normally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:92
msgid "To successfully make an API call to AWS, you will need to configure Boto (the Python interface to AWS). There are a `variety of methods <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html>`_ available, but the simplest is just to export two environment variables::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:97
msgid "You can test the script by itself to make sure your config is correct::"
msgstr ""

msgid "After a few moments, you should see your entire EC2 inventory across all regions in JSON."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:104
msgid "Since each region requires its own API call, if you are only using a small set of regions, feel free to edit ``ec2.ini`` and list only the regions you are interested in. There are other config options in ``ec2.ini`` including cache control, and destination variables."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:106
msgid "At their heart, inventory files are simply a mapping from some name to a destination address. The default ``ec2.ini`` settings are configured for running Ansible from outside EC2 (from your laptop for example) -- and this is not the most efficient way to manage EC2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_dynamic_inventory.rst:108
msgid "If you are running Ansible from within EC2, internal DNS names and IP addresses may make more sense than public DNS names. In this case, you can modify the ``destination_variable`` in ``ec2.ini`` to be the private DNS name of an instance. This is particularly important when running Ansible within a private subnet inside a VPC, where the only way to access an instance is via its private IP address. For VPC instances, `vpc_destination_variable` in ``ec2.ini`` provides a means of using which ever `boto.ec2.instance variable <http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/ref/ec2.html#module-boto.ec2.instance>`_ makes the most sense for your use case."
