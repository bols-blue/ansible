msgid "The ``shell`` module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments. It is almost exactly like the ``command`` module but runs the command through a shell (``/bin/sh``) on the remote node."

#: ../../../rst/shell_module.rst:104
msgid "If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be better to use the ``command`` module instead. Best practices when writing playbooks will follow the trend of using ``command`` unless ``shell`` is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/shell_module.rst:105
msgid "To sanitize any variables passed to the shell module, you should use \"{{ var | quote }}\" instead of just \"{{ var }}\" to make sure they don't include evil things like semicolons."

msgid "If you believe you have found a bug in this module, and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look in the `issue tracker at github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core>`_ to see if a bug has already been filed.  If not, we would be grateful if you would file one."

msgid "Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquries are welcome on the `ansible-project google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project>`_ or on Ansible's \"#ansible\" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.   Development oriented topics should instead use the similar `ansible-devel google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_."

msgid "This is a \"core\" ansible module, which means it will receive slightly higher priority for all requests than those in the \"extras\" repos."
