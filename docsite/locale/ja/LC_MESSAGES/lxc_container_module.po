msgid "The \"container_command\" can be used with any state except \"absent\". If used with state \"stopped\" the container will be \"started\", the command executed, and then the container \"stopped\" again. Likewise if the state is \"stopped\" and the container does not exist it will be first created, \"started\", the command executed, and then \"stopped\". If you use a \"|\" in the variable you can use common script formatting within the variable iteself The \"container_command\" option will always execute as BASH. When using \"container_command\" a log file is created in the /tmp/ directory which contains both stdout and stderr of any command executed."
