msgid "This is a wrapper around rsync. Of course you could just use the command action to call rsync yourself, but you also have to add a fair number of boilerplate options and host facts. You still may need to call rsync directly via ``command`` or ``shell`` depending on your use case. The synchronize action is meant to do common things with ``rsync`` easily. It does not provide access to the full power of rsync, but does make most invocations easier to follow."
