msgid "Vagrant is a tool to manage virtual machine environments, and allows you to configure and use reproducible work environments on top of various virtualization and cloud platforms. It also has integration with Ansible as a provisioner for these virtual machines, and the two tools work together well."

msgid "The first step once you've installed Vagrant is to create a ``Vagrantfile`` and customize it to suit your needs. This is covered in detail in the Vagrant documentation, but here is a quick example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_vagrant.rst:38
msgid "This will create a file called Vagrantfile that you can edit to suit your needs. The default Vagrantfile has a lot of comments. Here is a simplified example that includes a section to use the Ansible provisioner:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_vagrant.rst:58
msgid "The Vagrantfile has a lot of options, but these are the most important ones. Notice the ``config.vm.provision`` section that refers to an Ansible playbook called ``playbook.yml`` in the same directory as the Vagrantfile. Vagrant runs the provisioner once the virtual machine has booted and is ready for SSH access."

msgid "This will start the VM and run the provisioning playbook."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_vagrant.rst:70
msgid "There are a lot of Ansible options you can configure in your Vagrantfile. Some particularly useful options are ``ansible.extra_vars``, ``ansible.sudo`` and ``ansible.sudo_user``, and ``ansible.host_key_checking`` which you can disable to avoid SSH connection problems to new virtual machines."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_vagrant.rst:95
msgid "Vagrant automatically creates an inventory file for each Vagrant machine in the same directory located under ``.vagrant/provisioners/ansible/inventory/vagrant_ansible_inventory``. It configures the inventory file according to the SSH tunnel that Vagrant automatically creates, and executes ``ansible-playbook`` with the correct username and SSH key options to allow access. A typical automatically-created inventory file may look something like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_vagrant.rst:108
msgid "If you want to run Ansible manually, you will want to make sure to pass ``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` commands the correct arguments for the username (usually ``vagrant``) and the SSH key (since Vagrant 1.7.0, this will be something like ``.vagrant/machines/[machine name]/[provider]/private_key``), and the autogenerated inventory file."
