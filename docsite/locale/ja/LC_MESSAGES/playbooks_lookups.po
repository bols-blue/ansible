msgid "Lookup plugins allow access of data in Ansible from outside sources.  These plugins are evaluated on the Ansible control machine, and can include reading the filesystem but also contacting external datastores and services. These values are then made available using the standard templating system in Ansible, and are typically used to load variables or templates with information from those systems."
