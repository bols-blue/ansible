msgid "Introduction"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:9
msgid "Ansible contains a number of modules for controlling Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The purpose of this section is to explain how to put Ansible modules together (and use inventory scripts) to use Ansible in AWS context."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:12
msgid "Requirements for the AWS modules are minimal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:14
msgid "All of the modules require and are tested against recent versions of boto.  You'll need this Python module installed on your control machine.  Boto can be installed from your OS distribution or python's \"pip install boto\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:16
msgid "Whereas classically ansible will execute tasks in it's host loop against multiple remote machines, most cloud-control steps occur on your local machine with reference to the regions to control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:18
msgid "In your playbook steps we'll typically be using the following pattern for provisioning steps::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:29
msgid "Authentication"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:31
msgid "Authentication with the AWS-related modules is handled by either specifying your access and secret key as ENV variables or module arguments."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:50
msgid "The ec2 module provisions and de-provisions instances within EC2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:52
msgid "An example of making sure there are only 5 instances tagged 'Demo' in EC2 follows."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:54
msgid "In the example below, the \"exact_count\" of instances is set to 5.  This means if there are 0 instances already existing, then 5 new instances would be created.  If there were 2 instances, only 3 would be created, and if there were 8 instances, 3 instances would be terminated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:58
msgid "What is being counted is specified by the \"count_tag\" parameter.  The parameter \"instance_tags\" is used to apply tags to the newly created instance.::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:83
msgid "The data about what instances are created is being saved by the \"register\" keyword in the variable named \"ec2\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:85
msgid "From this, we'll use the add_host module to dynamically create a host group consisting of these new instances.  This facilitates performing configuration actions on the hosts immediately in a subsequent task.::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:113
msgid "With the host group now created, a second play at the bottom of the the same provisioning playbook file might now have some configuration steps::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Host Inventory"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:136
msgid "Once your nodes are spun up, you'll probably want to talk to them again.  With a cloud setup, it's best to not maintain a static list of cloud hostnames in text files.  Rather, the best way to handle this is to use the ec2 dynamic inventory script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:139
msgid "This will also dynamically select nodes that were even created outside of Ansible, and allow Ansible to manage them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:141
msgid "See the doc:`aws_example` for how to use this, then flip back over to this chapter."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:146
msgid "Tags And Groups And Variables"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:148
msgid "When using the ec2 inventory script, hosts automatically appear in groups based on how they are tagged in EC2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:150
msgid "For instance, if a host is given the \"class\" tag with the value of \"webserver\", it will be automatically discoverable via a dynamic group like so::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:157
msgid "Using this philosophy can be a great way to keep systems separated by the function they perform."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:159
msgid "In this example, if we wanted to define variables that are automatically applied to each machine tagged with the 'class' of 'webserver', 'group_vars' in ansible can be used.  See :doc:`splitting_out_vars`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:162
msgid "Similar groups are available for regions and other classifications, and can be similarly assigned variables using the same mechanism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:167
msgid "Autoscaling with Ansible Pull"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:169
msgid "Amazon Autoscaling features automatically increase or decrease capacity based on load.  There are also Ansible ansibles shown in the cloud documentation that can configure autoscaling policy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:172
msgid "When nodes come online, it may not be sufficient to wait for the next cycle of an ansible command to come along and configure that node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:174
msgid "To do this, pre-bake machine images which contain the necessary ansible-pull invocation.  Ansible-pull is a command line tool that fetches a playbook from a git server and runs it locally."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:176
msgid "One of the challenges of this approach is that there needs to be a centralized way to store data about the results of pull commands in an autoscaling context. For this reason, the autoscaling solution provided below in the next section can be a better approach."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:179
msgid "Read :ref:`ansible-pull` for more information on pull-mode playbooks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:184
msgid "Autoscaling with Ansible Tower"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:186
msgid ":doc:`tower` also contains a very nice feature for auto-scaling use cases.  In this mode, a simple curl script can call a defined URL and the server will \"dial out\" to the requester and configure an instance that is spinning up.  This can be a great way to reconfigure ephemeral nodes.  See the Tower install and product documentation for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:190
msgid "A benefit of using the callback in Tower over pull mode is that job results are still centrally recorded and less information has to be shared with remote hosts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:196
msgid "Ansible With (And Versus) CloudFormation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:198
msgid "CloudFormation is a Amazon technology for defining a cloud stack as a JSON document."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:200
msgid "Ansible modules provide an easier to use interface than CloudFormation in many examples, without defining a complex JSON document. This is recommended for most users."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:203
msgid "However, for users that have decided to use CloudFormation, there is an Ansible module that can be used to apply a CloudFormation template to Amazon."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:206
msgid "When using Ansible with CloudFormation, typically Ansible will be used with a tool like Packer to build images, and CloudFormation will launch those images, or ansible will be invoked through user data once the image comes online, or a combination of the two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:209
msgid "Please see the examples in the Ansible CloudFormation module for more details."
msgstr ""

msgid "AWS Image Building With Ansible"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:216
msgid "Many users may want to have images boot to a more complete configuration rather than configuring them entirely after instantiation.  To do this, one of many programs can be used with Ansible playbooks to define and upload a base image, which will then get it's own AMI ID for usage with the ec2 module or other Ansible AWS modules such as ec2_asg or the cloudformation module.   Possible tools include Packer, aminator, and Ansible's ec2_ami module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/guide_aws.rst:221
msgid "Generally speaking, we find most users using Packer."
msgstr ""

msgid "`Documentation for the Ansible Packer provisioner can be found here <https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/ansible-local.html>`_."
