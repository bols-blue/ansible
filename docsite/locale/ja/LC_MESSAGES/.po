msgid "For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list. Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, commonly called a \"hash\" or a \"dictionary\".  So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML."

msgid "There's another small quirk to YAML.  All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) should begin with ``---``.  This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start of a document."
