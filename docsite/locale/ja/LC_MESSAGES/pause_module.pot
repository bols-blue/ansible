msgid "Pauses playbook execution for a set amount of time, or until a prompt is acknowledged. All parameters are optional. The default behavior is to pause with a prompt. You can use ``ctrl+c`` if you wish to advance a pause earlier than it is set to expire or if you need to abort a playbook run entirely. To continue early: press ``ctrl+c`` and then ``c``. To abort a playbook: press ``ctrl+c`` and then ``a``. The pause module integrates into async/parallelized playbooks without any special considerations (see also: Rolling Updates). When using pauses with the ``serial`` playbook parameter (as in rolling updates) you are only prompted once for the current group of hosts."
