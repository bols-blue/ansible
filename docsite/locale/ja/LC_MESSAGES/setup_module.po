msgid "This module is automatically called by playbooks to gather useful variables about remote hosts that can be used in playbooks. It can also be executed directly by ``/usr/bin/ansible`` to check what variables are available to a host. Ansible provides many *facts* about the system, automatically."

msgid "More ansible facts will be added with successive releases. If *facter* or *ohai* are installed, variables from these programs will also be snapshotted into the JSON file for usage in templating. These variables are prefixed with ``facter_`` and ``ohai_`` so it's easy to tell their source. All variables are bubbled up to the caller. Using the ansible facts and choosing to not install *facter* and *ohai* means you can avoid Ruby-dependencies on your remote systems. (See also ``facter`` and ``ohai``.)"
