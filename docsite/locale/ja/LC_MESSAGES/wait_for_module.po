msgid "You can wait for a set amount of time ``timeout``, this is the default if nothing is specified. Waiting for a port to become available is useful for when services are not immediately available after their init scripts return which is true of certain Java application servers. It is also useful when starting guests with the ``virt`` module and needing to pause until they are ready. This module can also be used to wait for a regex match a string to be present in a file. In 1.6 and later, this module can also be used to wait for a file to be available or absent on the filesystem. In 1.8 and later, this module can also be used to wait for active connections to be closed before continuing, useful if a node is being rotated out of a load balancer pool."
