msgid "Ansible by default manages machines over the SSH protocol."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:22
msgid "Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running.  You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point.  When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there's no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version."

msgid "What Version To Pick?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:29
msgid "Because it runs so easily from source and does not require any installation of software on remote machines, many users will actually track the development version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:32
msgid "Ansible's release cycles are usually about two months long.  Due to this short release cycle, minor bugs will generally be fixed in the next release versus maintaining backports on the stable branch.  Major bugs will still have maintenance releases when needed, though these are infrequent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:37
msgid "If you are wishing to run the latest released version of Ansible and you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (TM), CentOS, Fedora, Debian, or Ubuntu, we recommend using the OS package manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:39
msgid "For other installation options, we recommend installing via \"pip\", which is the Python package manager, though other options are also available."

msgid "Managed Node Requirements"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:58
msgid "On the managed nodes, you only need Python 2.4 or later, but if you are running less than Python 2.5 on the remotes, you will also need:"

msgid "``python-simplejson``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:64
msgid "Ansible's \"raw\" module (for executing commands in a quick and dirty way) and the script module don't even need that.  So technically, you can use Ansible to install python-simplejson using the raw module, which then allows you to use everything else.  (That's jumping ahead though.)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:72
msgid "If you have SELinux enabled on remote nodes, you will also want to install libselinux-python on them before using any copy/file/template related functions in Ansible. You can of course still use the yum module in Ansible to install this package on remote systems that do not have it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_installation.rst:79
msgid "Python 3 is a slightly different language than Python 2 and most Python programs (including Ansible) are not switching over yet.  However, some Linux distributions (Gentoo, Arch) may not have a Python 2.X interpreter installed by default.  On those systems, you should install one, and set the 'ansible_python_interpreter' variable in inventory (see :doc:`intro_inventory`) to point at your 2.X Python.  Distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu all have a 2.X interpreter installed by default and this does not apply to those distributions.  This is also true of nearly all Unix systems.  If you need to bootstrap these remote systems by installing Python 2.X, using the 'raw' module will be able to do it remotely."

msgid "Ansible is trivially easy to run from a checkout, root permissions are not required to use it and there is no software to actually install for Ansible itself.  No daemons or database setup are required.  Because of this, many users in our community use the development version of Ansible all of the time, so they can take advantage of new features when they are implemented, and also easily contribute to the project. Because there is nothing to install, following the development version is significantly easier than most open source projects."
