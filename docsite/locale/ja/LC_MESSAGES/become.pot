msgid "Before 1.9 Ansible mostly allowed the use of sudo and a limited use of su to allow a login/remote user to become a different user and execute tasks, create resources with the 2nd user's permissions. As of 1.9 'become' supersedes the old sudo/su, while still being backwards compatible. This new system also makes it easier to add other privilege escalation tools like pbrun (Powerbroker), pfexec and others."
