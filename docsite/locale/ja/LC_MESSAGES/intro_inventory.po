msgid "Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time.  It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansible's inventory file, which defaults to being saved in the location /etc/ansible/hosts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:13
msgid "Not only is this inventory configurable, but you can also use multiple inventory files at the same time (explained below) and also pull inventory from dynamic or cloud sources, as described in :doc:`intro_dynamic_inventory`."

msgid "The things in brackets are group names, which are used in classifying systems and deciding what systems you are controlling at what times and for what purpose."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:38
msgid "It is ok to put systems in more than one group, for instance a server could be both a webserver and a dbserver. If you do, note that variables will come from all of the groups they are a member of, and variable precedence is detailed in a later chapter."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you have hosts that run on non-standard SSH ports you can put the port number after the hostname with a colon.  Ports listed in your SSH config file won't be used with the paramiko connection but will be used with the openssh connection."

msgid "To make things explicit, it is suggested that you set them if things are not running on the default port::"

msgid "Suppose you have just static IPs and want to set up some aliases that don't live in your host file, or you are connecting through tunnels.  You can do things like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:53
msgid "In the above example, trying to ansible against the host alias \"jumper\" (which may not even be a real hostname) will contact 192.168.1.50 on port 5555.  Note that this is using a feature of the inventory file to define some special variables.  Generally speaking this is not the best way to define variables that describe your system policy, but we'll share suggestions on doing this later.  We're just getting started."

msgid "Adding a lot of hosts?  If you have a lot of hosts following similar patterns you can do this rather than listing each hostname::"

msgstr ""

msgid "The preferred practice in Ansible is actually not to store variables in the main inventory file."

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:174
msgid "As an advanced use-case, you can create *directories* named after your groups or hosts, and Ansible will read all the files in these directories. An example with the 'raleigh' group::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:180
msgid "All hosts that are in the 'raleigh' group will have the variables defined in these files available to them. This can be very useful to keep your variables organized when a single file starts to be too big, or when you want to use :doc:`Ansible Vault<playbooks_vault>` on a part of a group's variables. Note that this only works on Ansible 1.4 or later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_inventory.rst:185
msgid "Tip: In Ansible 1.2 or later the group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories can exist in either the playbook directory OR the inventory directory. If both paths exist, variables in the playbook directory will override variables set in the inventory directory."
