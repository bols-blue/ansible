msgid "Sometimes a command that returns 0 isn't an error.  Sometimes a command might not always need to report that it 'changed' the remote system.  This section describes how to change the default behavior of Ansible for certain tasks so output and error handling behavior is as desired."

msgid "Handlers and Failure"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/playbooks_error_handling.rst:39
msgid "When a task fails on a host, handlers which were previously notified will *not* be run on that host. This can lead to cases where an unrelated failure can leave a host in an unexpected state. For example, a task could update a configuration file and notify a handler to restart some service. If a task later on in the same play fails, the service will not be restarted despite the configuration change."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/playbooks_error_handling.rst:46
msgid "You can change this behavior with the ``--force-handlers`` command-line option, or by including ``force_handlers: True`` in a play, or ``force_handlers = True`` in ansible.cfg. When handlers are forced, they will run when notified even if a task fails on that host. (Note that certain errors could still prevent the handler from running, such as a host becoming unreachable.)"
