msgid "What's an ad-hoc command?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:13
msgid "An ad-hoc command is something that you might type in to do something really quick, but don't want to save for later."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:16
msgid "This is a good place to start to understand the basics of what Ansible can do prior to learning the playbooks language -- ad-hoc commands can also be used to do quick things that you might not necessarily want to write a full playbook for."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:21
msgid "Generally speaking, the true power of Ansible lies in playbooks. Why would you use ad-hoc tasks versus playbooks?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:24
msgid "For instance, if you wanted to power off all of your lab for Christmas vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:27
msgid "For configuration management and deployments, though, you'll want to pick up on using '/usr/bin/ansible-playbook' -- the concepts you will learn here will port over directly to the playbook language."

msgid "Let's use Ansible's command line tool to reboot all web servers in Atlanta, 10 at a time.  First, let's set up SSH-agent so it can remember our credentials::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:49
msgid "If you don't want to use ssh-agent and want to instead SSH with a password instead of keys, you can with ``--ask-pass`` (``-k``), but it's much better to just use ssh-agent."
msgstr ""

msgid "Now to run the command on all servers in a group, in this case, *atlanta*, in 10 parallel forks::"
msgstr ""

msgid "/usr/bin/ansible will default to running from your user account.  If you do not like this behavior, pass in \"-u username\".  If you want to run commands as a different user, it looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Often you'll not want to just do things from your user account.  If you want to run commands through sudo::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:67
msgid "Use ``--ask-sudo-pass`` (``-K``) if you are not using passwordless sudo.  This will interactively prompt you for the password to use. Use of passwordless sudo makes things easier to automate, but it's not required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:72
msgid "It is also possible to sudo to a user other than root using ``--sudo-user`` (``-U``)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:79
msgid "Rarely, some users have security rules where they constrain their sudo environment to running specific command paths only. This does not work with ansible's no-bootstrapping philosophy and hundreds of different modules. If doing this, use Ansible from a special account that does not have this constraint. One way of doing this without sharing access to unauthorized users would be gating Ansible with :doc:`tower`, which can hold on to an SSH credential and let members of certain organizations use it on their behalf without having direct access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:85
msgid "Ok, so those are basics.  If you didn't read about patterns and groups yet, go back and read :doc:`intro_patterns`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:87
msgid "The ``-f 10`` in the above specifies the usage of 10 simultaneous processes to use.   You can also set this in :doc:`intro_configuration` to avoid setting it again.  The default is actually 5, which is really small and conservative.  You are probably going to want to talk to a lot more simultaneous hosts so feel free to crank this up.  If you have more hosts than the value set for the fork count, Ansible will talk to them, but it will take a little longer.  Feel free to push this value as high as your system can handle it!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:93
msgid "You can also select what Ansible \"module\" you want to run.  Normally commands also take a ``-m`` for module name, but the default module name is 'command', so we didn't need to specify that all of the time.  We'll use ``-m`` in later examples to run some other :doc:`modules`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:99
msgid "The :ref:`command` module does not support shell variables and things like piping.  If we want to execute a module using a shell, use the 'shell' module instead. Read more about the differences on the :doc:`modules` page."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:104
msgid "Using the :ref:`shell` module looks like this::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:108
msgid "When running any command with the Ansible *ad hoc* CLI (as opposed to :doc:`Playbooks <playbooks>`), pay particular attention to shell quoting rules, so the local shell doesn't eat a variable before it gets passed to Ansible. For example, using double vs single quotes in the above example would evaluate the variable on the box you were on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:114
msgid "So far we've been demoing simple command execution, but most Ansible modules usually do not work like simple scripts. They make the remote system look like you state, and run the commands necessary to get it there.  This is commonly referred to as 'idempotence', and is a core design goal of Ansible. However, we also recognize that running arbitrary commands is equally important, so Ansible easily supports both."

msgid "Polling is built-in and looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The above example says \"run for 30 minutes max (``-B``: 30*60=1800), poll for status (``-P``) every 60 seconds\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:246
msgid "Poll mode is smart so all jobs will be started before polling will begin on any machine. Be sure to use a high enough ``--forks`` value if you want to get all of your jobs started very quickly. After the time limit (in seconds) runs out (``-B``), the process on the remote nodes will be terminated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/intro_adhoc.rst:251
msgid "Typically you'll only be backgrounding long-running shell commands or software upgrades only.  Backgrounding the copy module does not do a background file transfer.  :doc:`Playbooks <playbooks>` also support polling, and have a simplified syntax for this."
