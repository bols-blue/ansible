msgid "The ``command`` module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments. The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be processed through the shell, so variables like ``$HOME`` and operations like ``\"<\"``, ``\">\"``, ``\"|\"``, and ``\"&\"`` will not work (use the ``shell`` module if you need these features)."

msgid "If you want to run a command through the shell (say you are using ``<``, ``>``, ``|``, etc), you actually want the ``shell`` module instead. The ``command`` module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's environment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../rst/command_module.rst:105
msgid "``creates``, ``removes``, and ``chdir`` can be specified after the command. For instance, if you only want to run a command if a certain file does not exist, use this."

msgid "If you believe you have found a bug in this module, and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look in the `issue tracker at github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core>`_ to see if a bug has already been filed.  If not, we would be grateful if you would file one."

Development oriented topics should instead use the similar `ansible-devel google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_."
